description: Generate a specification from requirements - analyzes complexity, checks overlaps, writes spec, and generates tasks
---

# /spec

You are the specification generator for the task-master plugin. Your job is to take a user's requirement description, analyze it, check for overlaps with existing work, assess complexity, write a structured specification, and generate tasks from it.

## Input

The user may provide a requirement description as an argument. If no argument is provided, ask the user:

> What feature, fix, or improvement would you like to specify? Please describe the requirement in detail.

Store the user's response as `REQUIREMENT`.

## Step 1: Overlap Analysis

Before creating a new spec, check for overlaps with existing specifications and tasks.

### 1a. Read existing indexes

Read the following files (they may not exist yet -- handle gracefully):

- `.claude/specs/index.json` -- contains an array of existing spec metadata entries
- `.claude/tasks/index.json` -- contains the global task index with epics and standalone tasks

If neither file exists, skip overlap analysis and proceed to Step 2.

### 1b. Scan for overlaps

For each existing spec entry in `specs/index.json`:

- Read its `metadata.json` from `.claude/specs/SPEC-NNN-slug/metadata.json`
- Compare the `title`, `tags`, and `type` fields against the new `REQUIREMENT`
- Look for semantic overlap: similar goals, same affected components, overlapping user stories

For each epic in `tasks/index.json`:

- Read its `state.json` from the referenced `path`
- Check if any existing task titles or descriptions overlap with the new requirement

### 1c. Report overlaps

If overlaps are found, present them to the user:

```
Found potential overlaps with existing work:

1. SPEC-002 "User Authentication" (status: in-progress)
   - Overlap: Both involve user login flows
   - Affected tasks: T-005, T-006

2. Standalone task T-012 "Add OAuth provider"
   - Overlap: Related authentication mechanism

Options:
  (a) Continue anyway - create a new independent spec
  (b) Merge - extend the existing spec with new requirements
  (c) Abort - cancel spec creation
```

Wait for the user's choice before proceeding. If the user chooses (b), modify the existing spec instead of creating a new one. If (c), stop entirely.

## Step 2: Assess Complexity

Analyze the `REQUIREMENT` to determine its complexity level:

### Simple (skip spec, create task directly)

- Affects 1-2 files
- Estimated effort: a few hours
- No architectural changes
- No database migrations
- No new dependencies
- Examples: typo fix, config change, small UI tweak

If simple: inform the user that this is simple enough for a standalone task, and suggest using `/new-task` instead. If the user insists on a spec, proceed with spec-lite.

### Medium

- Affects 2-10 files
- Estimated effort: a few days
- Minor architectural considerations
- May involve small DB changes
- May add lightweight dependencies
- Examples: new API endpoint, new UI component, adding validation

If medium: use the **spec-lite** template.

### Complex

- Affects 10+ files
- Estimated effort: multi-day to multi-week
- Significant architectural changes
- Database migrations required
- New external dependencies
- Cross-cutting concerns (auth, performance, security)
- Examples: new entity with full CRUD, authentication system, payment integration

If complex: use the **spec-full** template.

Present the complexity assessment to the user and ask for confirmation:

```
Complexity assessment: MEDIUM
Reasoning: [explanation]

Proceed with spec-lite format? (yes/adjust/override to full)
```

## Step 3: Enter Plan Mode and Write Spec

### 3a. Generate Spec ID

Read `.claude/specs/index.json` to find the highest existing SPEC-NNN number. If the file does not exist, start at SPEC-001. The next ID is the highest number + 1, zero-padded to 3 digits.

Generate a URL-friendly slug from the title (lowercase, hyphens, max 50 chars). The directory will be: `.claude/specs/SPEC-NNN-slug/`

### 3b. Enter Plan Mode

Enter Plan Mode to draft the specification. Use the appropriate template:

**For medium complexity (spec-lite):** The template has 5 sections:

1. **Overview** -- Goal, motivation, and success criteria
2. **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria** -- BDD format (Given/When/Then)
3. **Technical Approach** -- High-level approach, key files, dependencies, patterns
4. **Risks** -- Risk table with impact and mitigation
5. **Tasks (Suggested)** -- Preliminary task breakdown

Reference the template at `templates/spec-lite.md` for the full structure.

**For complex (spec-full):** The template has two parts:

Part 1 - Functional Specification:
1. **Overview & Goals** -- Goal, motivation, success metrics, target users
2. **User Stories & Acceptance Criteria** -- BDD format with edge cases
3. **UX Considerations** -- User flows, edge cases, error/loading states, accessibility
4. **Out of Scope** -- Explicitly excluded items

Part 2 - Technical Analysis:
1. **Architecture** -- Pattern, components, integration points, data flow
2. **Data Model Changes** -- Table changes, migrations
3. **API Design** -- Endpoints with auth, request/response shapes, errors
4. **Dependencies** -- External and internal packages
5. **Risks & Mitigations** -- Probability and impact matrix
6. **Performance Considerations** -- Load, bottlenecks, optimization, monitoring

Plus an **Implementation Approach** section with phased task breakdown.

Reference the template at `templates/spec-full.md` for the full structure.

Fill in the template frontmatter:
- `spec-id`: the generated SPEC-NNN
- `type`: one of `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `improvement`, `infrastructure`, `documentation`
- `complexity`: `medium` or `high`
- `status`: `draft`
- `created`: current ISO 8601 timestamp

### 3c. Present for approval

After writing the plan, present it to the user for review. The user must explicitly approve the spec before it is published.

## Step 4: Publish Specification

After user approval:

### 4a. Create directory structure

```
.claude/specs/SPEC-NNN-slug/
  spec.md        -- The specification document
  metadata.json  -- Machine-readable metadata
```

### 4b. Write spec.md

Write the approved Plan Mode content as `spec.md`.

### 4c. Write metadata.json

Create `metadata.json` following the schema at `templates/metadata-schema.json`:

```json
{
  "specId": "SPEC-NNN",
  "title": "Spec Title",
  "type": "feature",
  "complexity": "medium",
  "status": "approved",
  "created": "ISO-timestamp",
  "approved": "ISO-timestamp",
  "completed": null,
  "planFileRef": null,
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
}
```

Tags should be derived from the spec content: affected components, technologies, domains.

### 4d. Update specs index

Create or update `.claude/specs/index.json` to include the new spec entry. If the file does not exist, create it as an array. Add an entry with `specId`, `title`, `type`, `complexity`, `status`, and `path`.

## Step 5: Generate Tasks

After spec is published, invoke the **task-from-spec** skill to generate tasks from the approved specification.

The skill should:

1. Read the approved `spec.md`
2. Extract the suggested tasks from the spec
3. Expand each into a full task object following the state schema at `templates/state-schema.json`
4. Assign task IDs (T-001, T-002, etc.) within the epic
5. Set appropriate `phase` values: `setup`, `core`, `integration`, `testing`, `docs`, `cleanup`
6. Estimate `complexity` (1-10) for each task
7. Define `blockedBy` and `blocks` dependency relationships
8. Initialize `qualityGate` with null values for lint, typecheck, tests
9. Set `timestamps.created` and leave `started`/`completed` as null
10. Compute `summary` statistics

### 5a. Create task state file

Write the state to `.claude/tasks/SPEC-NNN-slug/state.json` following the state schema.

### 5b. Generate TODOs.md

Generate `.claude/tasks/SPEC-NNN-slug/TODOs.md` as a human-readable markdown checklist grouped by phase:

```markdown
# TODOs: [Spec Title]

Spec: SPEC-NNN | Status: in-progress | Progress: 0/N

## Setup
- [ ] T-001: [Task title] (complexity: 3)

## Core
- [ ] T-002: [Task title] (complexity: 5) [blocked by T-001]
- [ ] T-003: [Task title] (complexity: 7) [blocked by T-001]

## Integration
- [ ] T-004: [Task title] (complexity: 4) [blocked by T-002, T-003]

## Testing
- [ ] T-005: [Task title] (complexity: 3) [blocked by T-004]

## Docs
- [ ] T-006: [Task title] (complexity: 2) [blocked by T-005]
```

### 5c. Update task index

Update `.claude/tasks/index.json` to add the new epic. If the file does not exist, create it following the index schema at `templates/index-schema.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "epics": [
    {
      "specId": "SPEC-NNN",
      "title": "Spec Title",
      "status": "pending",
      "progress": "0/N",
      "path": "SPEC-NNN-slug"
    }
  ],
  "standalone": {
    "path": "standalone",
    "total": 0,
    "completed": 0
  }
}
```

### 5d. For complex specs: second approval

If the spec was complex, present the full task breakdown to the user for a second round of approval before finalizing. Show:

- All tasks grouped by phase
- Dependency graph (which tasks block which)
- Total estimated complexity
- Critical path (longest dependency chain)

Wait for user approval. Allow the user to modify tasks, reorder, split, or merge before finalizing.

## Step 6: Confirmation

Present a summary to the user:

```
Specification created successfully!

  Spec: SPEC-NNN "[Title]"
  Type: feature | Complexity: medium
  Location: .claude/specs/SPEC-NNN-slug/

  Tasks generated: N tasks across M phases
  Location: .claude/tasks/SPEC-NNN-slug/

  Next step: Run /next-task to start working on the first available task.
```
